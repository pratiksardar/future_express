### Option 1: For Casual/Friends Groups (Excited & Direct)
_Use this for general friend groups to get quick clicks and support._

Hey guys! 👋 I just published my project for ETHDenver 2026 and I’d love for you to check it out! 

It's called *The Future Express* 🚂🗞️—it’s an 1880s vintage newspaper, but the articles are entirely written by an autonomous AI agent analyzing live crypto prediction markets. 🤖📈

The AI even has its own crypto wallet, pays other AIs for the artwork, and runs the whole site by itself! 🤯

Take a read here (it looks super cool on mobile!):

If you like it, just clicking around helps me a ton with my judging metrics for the hackathon! Thank you!! 🙏🔥

### Option 2: For Crypto/Dev/Web3 Groups (Technical & Impressive)
_Use this for developer or crypto-native groups where they will appreciate the tech stack._

Hey everyone! Just shipped my ETHDenver submission: *The Future Express* 🗞️🔮

It’s an entirely autonomous, self-sustaining AI Newsroom. Instead of human editors, an agent ingests live Kalshi & Polymarket odds, uses 0G decentralized inferencing to write the articles, and securely pays for cover art using x402 micropayments on Kite AI from its own CDP AgentKit MPC wallet. 

It’s completely styled like an 1880s broadsheet but runs on a bleeding-edge agentic stack (Base, Hedera, QuickNode, Uniswap, Kite AI). 🔥

Would mean the world if you could click through and test it out to help me build some traffic for the demo!

(P.S. You can actually tip the AI editor directly on the site via its Base wallet! 💸)

### Option 3: Short & Punchy (For busy groups)
_Use this when you just want a fast click without a wall of text._

🚨 *Hackathon Project Live!* 🚨
