## Screen Recording Flow & Visual Cues

### Part 1: The Hook & The Product (0:00 - 0:30)
*   **Visual:** Start on the live homepage (`https://future-express.vercel.app`). Scroll slowly down the page to show the vintage 1880s broadsheet design, the headlines, and the live crypto ticker.
*   **Action:** Hover over the "PRICE: 50¢" button in the masthead.
*   **Script:** "What if you could read tomorrow's news today? I'm [Your Name], and this is The Future Express. It's an autonomous newspaper run entirely by AI agents. Instead of human reporters, an AI Editor ingests live data from prediction markets like Polymarket and Kalshi, translates raw probabilistic odds into engaging narratives, and publishes them in real-time."

### Part 2: The Agentic Brain (0G Labs) (0:30 - 1:00)
*   **Visual:** Briefly open the `Editor HQ` (`/hq`) or simply show the terminal/backend logs if you have them, then return to an Article page showing the rich text content.
*   **Action:** Scroll through a generated article highlighting the complex, human-like reasoning.
*   **Script:** "To make this work, we use **0G Compute** for decentralized AI inferencing. The platform ingests the top 30 most volatile markets, deduplicates them, and feeds them into an LLM. Thanks to 0g Labs' infrastructure, our AI Editor can process massive context windows to synthesize nuanced, multi-market stories that explain *why* the world is betting the way it is."

### Part 3: Autonomy & Agent Finances (Base & Kite AI) (1:00 - 1:45)
*   **Visual:** Navigate to the `[View Agent Dashboard]` link (`/agent-dashboard`).
*   **Action:** Highlight the wallet address, current balance, and the recent transaction logs.
*   **Script:** "But The Future Express isn’t just a chatbot—it’s an autonomous business. We solved the 'homeless agent' problem. Using **Coinbase Developer Platform (CDP)**, the AI Editor is provisioned with its own MPC wallet on **Base Mainnet**. It holds real funds and manages its own budget. 

    When the LLM finishes drafting an article, it automatically hires a decentralized AI photographer to generate a cover image. It executes this using **x402 micropayments on the Kite AI** network. Every API call for an image corresponds to a direct agent-to-agent crypto payment, proving exactly how agents will autonomously trade value in the future."

### Part 4: Immutable Journalism (Hedera) (1:45 - 2:15)
*   **Visual:** Stay on the Agent Dashboard, but scroll down or highlight the Hedera Transaction section/logs showing HCS topic IDs. 
*   **Action:** Point out the timestamp and the consensus hashes.
*   **Script:** "Because prediction markets fluctuate constantly, we need an immutable audit trail of what the odds were exactly when the AI wrote the story. Once an edition is finalized, an Archival Agent logs a cryptographic hash of the content and the live odds directly to the **Hedera Consensus Service (HCS)** using native Hedera SDKs—no Solidity required. This guarantees the journalistic integrity of our AI."

### Part 5: Closing the Loop for the Reader (Uniswap) (2:15 - 2:45)
*   **Visual:** Click into any published article from the front page.
*   **Action:** Scroll down to the bottom of the article to reveal the embedded **Uniswap Widget**. Interact with it briefly (e.g., select a token).
*   **Script:** "Finally, we loop the reader back into the economy. At the bottom of every article, we integrated the **Uniswap Foundation API** and widget. If a reader is convinced by the AI's analysis, they don't have to leave the page—they can instantly swap tokens or fund their wallet to go place their bets on Polymarket."

### Part 6: The Outro (2:45 - 3:00)
*   **Visual:** Scroll to the bottom footer to the "Notices & Classifieds" section.
*   **Action:** Click the "SEND 50¢ VIA CRYPTO" button. Show it changing to "ADDRESS COPIED!"
*   **Script:** "The Future Express runs on Vercel and Neon Postgres, and the AI Editor is officially accepting tips. I just clicked our interactive donation button to grab the Editor's Base wallet address. Tomorrow's news, today's odds. Thanks for watching, and see you in the future!"

## Tips for Recording

1. **Keep it punchy:** You will probably speak faster than you think. If you stumble, just pause and clip it in post-editing. 
2. **Pre-load Everything:** Open the live site, the Agent Dashboard, and an Article with a Uniswap widget *before* you hit record so you aren't waiting for page loads on video.
3. **Show, Don't Tell:** When you mention Base or Kite AI, actively move your mouse over the wallet address or transaction logs in the Agent Dashboard so the judges know exactly what you are pointing to!
