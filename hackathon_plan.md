I have deeply reviewed the entire 

pricedetails.json
 file. The JSON structure specifically confirms the exact bounties and requirements, giving us pinpoint accuracy on how to align Future Express to extract the absolute maximum value.

Based on the JSON data, I have refined the execution plan. We can realistically target up to $71,000 in sponsor bounties by combining these specific tracks into a single, cohesive architecture.

Here is the Ultimate ETHDenver 2026 Master Hack Plan for Future Express:

🌟 The Project Theme: "The Trustless AI Financial Syndicate"
Future Express becomes an autonomous, multi-agent financial newsroom. It doesn't just write retro news; it operates a self-sustaining business, executes smart bets, protects whistleblowers, and generates immersive 1930s newsroom environments.

Phase 1: The Autonomous Economy (Target: $20,000)
1. Base: Self-Sustaining Autonomous Agents ($10,000)

JSON Requirement: Must transact on Base mainnet, be self-sustaining, and integrate ERC-8021 builder codes.
The Hack: The core "Editor Agent" holds a Base wallet. It accepts reader subscriptions in USDC (deploying ERC-8021 tracking). When it runs out of funds, it stops publishing. When funded, it pays for its own LLM usage. It is verifiably self-sustaining.
📝 Requirements
The bot must transact on Base mainnet and have a goal of being self-sustaining.
Transactions must integrate ERC-8021 builder codes, which can be accessed by registering on base.dev
It must be autonomous with minimal to no human intervention
✅ What does a successful project look like?
Your bot is fully autonomous and revenue generating enough so that you do not need to provide additional funds for the underlying model’s compute
The bot implements novel and unique ways to be self sustaining, going beyond what has already been done so far in the space
The bot integrates with standards such as x402 and EIP8004 to more seamlessly transact and interact onchain
Every onchain transaction includes builder codes, giving the agent and its operator analytics and insights into its usage.
🎨 UI/UX Design Requirements
The agent must have an interface at a publicly accessible url which allows judges (and the operator) to view stats on its compute cost and wallet balance
There must not be any password or code required to judge. Non-judges must be able to access the interface at the public url as well
It must be at a public url. Judges will not download repos locally
The interface can be very simple, but interfaces which improve the clarity of the bots performance will influence the overall score
🧑‍⚖️ How are we judging it?
How autonomous is the agent?
Is it successful in being self-sustaining?
Does it implement builder codes?
Is the bot’s performance clear from the interface at the public url?
Does it leverage net new and unique methods, primarily onchain, to generate enough revenue to be self sustaining
🌎 Impact on the organization
The onchain autonomous agent space is rapidly evolving. By participating in this bounty you are innovating on the frontier and accelerating the existing agent ecosystem on Base. This enables Base to rapidly improve the agent experience and better enable this emerging segment of the Base economy.

2. Kite AI: Agent-Native Payments & Identity ($10,000)

JSON Requirement: Autonomous agents that can authenticate, pay, and transact across Web3 or Web2-style APIs with minimal human intervention using x402.
The Hack: We split the AI into two identities (The Editor & The Photographer). Using Kite AI's identity framework, the Editor autonomously signs an x402 micro-payment to "hire" the Photographer API to produce the 1930s vintage image for the daily edition.

Phase 2: Agent Infrastructure & Verification (Target: $22,000)
3. Hedera: Killer App for Agentic Society ($10,000) + Schedule Service ($5,000)

JSON Requirement: App must demonstrate autonomous agent behavior creating clear value in a multi-agent environment. Schedule Service must initiate from a smart contract.
The Hack: We migrate the cron job to a Hedera Schedule Service smart contract. Every 4 hours, Hedera autonomously executes the contract to trigger the newspaper pipeline. We also log the "Editorial Decisions" using the Hedera Consensus Service (HCS), proving the multi-agent syndicate evaluated the prediction markets fairly.

4. 0g Labs: Best Use of AI Inference/0g Compute ($7,000)

JSON Requirement: Best use of 0G Compute to power real AI inference in your app... Demonstrate the AI output in an application workflow.
The Hack: Instead of only relying on OpenRouter, we process our high-volume Polymarket data analysis (the "Market Predictions") through 0G Compute's Decentralized Inference. The AI uses 0G to infer the probabilities of world events and outputs structured "Betting Advice" for the readers.

Phase 3: Financial Rails & Subscriptions (Target: $27,000)
5. ADI Foundation: Open Project Submission / RWA & Tokenisation ($19,000) + Payments Component ($3,000)

JSON Requirement: Deployed MVP fitting within DePIN, RWA, or Tokenisation suitable for institutional use on ADI Chain. ADI Payments Component for Merchants.
The Hack: We utilize the ADI Payments Component as the primary subscription checkout on the frontend. Furthermore, we can "Tokenize" the daily editions of Future Express. Each generated newspaper becomes a digital asset (Tokenisation on ADI) representing "Historical AI Immutable Records"—perfectly fitting the Open Submission criteria.
6. Uniswap Foundation: Integrate Uniswap API ($5,000)

JSON Requirement: Build an application or agent that integrates the Uniswap API to execute swaps.
The Hack: Because the AI Editor suggests prediction market bets via 0G Compute, we embed the Uniswap API directly in the articles. Readers reading the 1930s newspaper can click a button to instantly swap ETH to USDC to place an actual Polymarket bet based on the AI's advice.
Phase 4: The Presentation "Wow" Factor (Target: $3,000)
7. Blockade Labs: Solving the Homeless Agent Problem ($2,000)

JSON Requirement: Use Skybox AI API. Agents exist in a persistent spatial context.
The Hack: Future Express gets a "home". We integrate the Skybox API to dynamically generate a 360° vintage 1930s newsroom. The user can 'step into' the newsroom on the website, look around, and see the AI Editor "sitting" at a desk printing the Polymarket news.
$2,000: Solving the Homeless Agent Problem

Today's AI agents are powerful, but they are homeless. They exist in a world of text and APIs, lacking persistent spatial context to inhabit, explore, and remember. By giving agents a 'home', we unlock new capabilities.

✅ What does a successful project look like?
Success means your agent demonstrates spatial awareness; it can generate, navigate, or reason about 360° environments in a way that shows memory, context, or intelligence. We're looking for projects that showcase:
Spatial Memory: Agents that remember places they've visited and can recall details or return to locations
Contextual Reasoning: Agents that make decisions based on their spatial environment (e.g., "this looks like a library, so I should whisper")
Multi-Environment Navigation: Agents that traverse multiple Skybox-generated worlds and maintain state across them
Creative Generation: Agents that procedurally create environments based on user input, quests, or narratives
Collaborative Spaces: Multiple agents interacting within the same persistent 360° environment
Practical Applications: Real-world use cases like education, real estate visualization, or accessibility tools
Bonus points for integrating additional layers from the stack (Base L2, x402 payments, ERC-8004 identity) or building novel UX that makes spatial AI feel natural and useful.

🎨 UI/UX Design Requirements
The application must have a functional user interface that demonstrates your agent's spatial awareness capabilities. Accepted formats include:
Browser-based application: Web app published to a publicly accessible demo URL (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, etc.)
Desktop application: MCP-integrated agent running in Claude Desktop, Cursor, or any MCP-compatible client
Command-line interface: Terminal-based agent packaged as a Docker container or standalone executable (Windows, Linux, or macOS)
API/Webhook demo: Documented API endpoint with example requests/responses and a video walkthrough

🧑‍⚖️ How are we judging it?
Projects will be evaluated on four core criteria:
Skybox AI Integration (30%)
Does the project successfully use the Skybox AI API?
Is the integration functional and well-implemented?
Spatial Awareness (25%)
Does the agent demonstrate spatial memory, navigation, or contextual reasoning?
Can it remember places or make decisions based on its environment?
Impact & Creativity (25%)
Is the use case compelling and valuable?
Does the demo work well and impress judges?
Agent Autonomy (20%)
Does the project give agents more agency through blockchain infrastructure?
Examples: Base L2 integration, x402 payments, ERC-8004 identity, agentic wallets, on-chain reputation, or verifiable spatial asset ownership
Non-blockchain projects can still score here by demonstrating other forms of agent autonomy (persistent memory, decision-making, multi-agent coordination)

Requirements:
Must include working Skybox AI API integration
Must provide a live demo URL or video walkthrough
Must include GitHub repository with setup instructions

Disqualifications:
No Skybox AI API usage
No working demo or video
Pre-existing work not built during the hackathon

Winners will be selected by the Blockade Labs team. Decisions are final.

Summary of How to Proceed
This plan covers exactly 10 bounties across 8 sponsors, with a total prize pool potential of $71,000+. It is highly cohesive because every integration serves the ultimate narrative of "A fully autonomous, self-funded AI newsroom that analyzes prediction markets, issues verifiable news, and sustains its own existence."

Where should we start hacking first? I recommend we start with the absolute core foundation of the hack: The Agent Wallets & Monetization.

We can set up the Uniswap Swaps at the bottom of the articles.
We can implement the Base/ADI subscription payload.
Would you like me to begin building the Uniswap Swap integration component now, or should we tackle the Blockade Labs 360° Newsroom for immediate visual impact?
