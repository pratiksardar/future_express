It discovers a market, evaluates probabilities, places a trade using Hedera HTS tokens, and receives automated settlement based on on-chain attestations of agent actions.\n\n### 🎨 UI/UX Design Requirements\n\nThe UI is for humans observing agents, but the product is not meant to be human-operated. SHould include an interface that shows the agent flow steps and states. Browser demo URL preferred. Reputation / trust indicators (maybe using ERC-8004) are nice to have.\n\n### 🧑‍⚖️ How are we judging it?\n\n- Innovation: How new is the idea?\n- Feasibility: How feasible is the idea?\n- Execution: How well did the team develop / build the idea?\n- Integration: How well does the idea / solution use Hedera etc.?\n- Validation: What does the market think of the idea / solution?\n- Success: Does the idea impact Hedera’s success metrics: accounts, active accounts, TPS etc.?\n- Pitch: How well is the idea / solution presented / sold by the team?\n\n### 🌎 Impact on the organization\n\nPositions Hedera as foundational infrastructure for the Agentic Society by enabling trust, coordination, and value exchange between autonomous agents throughl HTS usage, on-chain attestations, and repeat agent-initiated transactions as agent-native applications emerge.\n\n### 📚 Resources\n\nResource Links\n- <https://docs.openclaw.ai/start/getting-started>\n- <https://docs.hedera.com/>\n- <https://github.com/erc-8004>\n- <https://github.com/hedera-dev/tutorial-ucp-hedera>\n- <https://github.com/hedera-dev/hedera-agent-skills>\n- <https://portal.hedera.com>\n\n### 👀 Some example use cases\n\n- Agents hiring other agents\n- Agents pooling capital\n- Agents competing for tasks\n- Agents subscribing to other agents’ outputs\n- Agent DAOs / guilds / collectives / cults\n\n### 💼 Recruitment Opportunities\n\nWork for Hashgraph - https://www.hashgraph.com/careers/\nIncubator Programmes in April and November",

Native Sponsorship\n\n- Counterfactual smart account\n- Sponsored UserOperation\n- Account action succeeds with zero native balance\n- Paymaster native balance decreases\n\n### E2E Flow B. ERC20 Sponsorship\n\n- Mock ERC20 deployed\n- Smart account funded with ERC20 only\n- Sponsored UserOperation\n- Gas paid by paymaster in native token\n- ERC20 deducted from smart account\n\nEach flow must output:\n\n- Transaction hash\n- Smart account address\n- Paymaster balance deltas\n\n### 5. Failure Cases\n\nAt least one of the following must be demonstrated in tests:\n\n- Invalid sponsorship signature\n- Expired sponsorship\n- Disallowed call target or selector\n- Underfunded ERC20 payment\n\n## Allowed Infrastructure\n\nYou may use:\n\n- Pimlico bundler, including self-hosted Docker setups\n- Safe, Kernel, or other ERC-4337-compatible smart accounts\n- Any ERC-4337 tooling stack\n\nHosted paymaster services are not available on this network.\n\nYou must deploy and operate their own paymaster contracts.\n\n## Explicitly Out of Scope\n\n- EOAs\n- Meta-tx relayers\n- EIP-7702 flows\n- Pure contract redeploys with no tooling or tests\n\n### ✅ What does a successful project look like?\n\n## Deliverables\n\nEach submission must include:\n\n- Source code\n- Deployment and configuration instructions\n- E2E test scripts\n- README explaining:\n - Sponsorship model\n - Security assumptions\n - How another dApp would reuse this\n\n### 🎨 UI/UX Design Requirements\n\nProvide tooling to operate the system. This can be:\n\n- A CLI tool, or\n- A Foundry-based scripting interface, or\n- Both\n\nMinimum required capabilities:\n\n- Deploy native and ERC20 paymasters\n- Configure sponsor signer or backend authorisation\n- Generate sponsorship data to attach to a UserOperation\n\nClarity and reusability matter more than language choice.\n\n### 🧑‍⚖️ How are we judging it?\n\nSubmissions will be judged on:\n\n- Correct ERC-4337 usage\n- Security and abuse considerations\n- Developer experience\n- Reusability by third-party teams\n- Clarity of documentation\n\nBonus consideration for:\n\n- Session-aware sponsorship\n- Rate limiting or spend caps\n- Clean APIs around `paymasterAndData`\n\n### 🌎 Impact on the organization\n\nOther teams should realistically be able to reuse when building a dApp that intends using Gas Abstraction.\n\n### 📚 Resources\n\nFind our org github: <https://github.com/ADI-Foundation-Labs>\nADI Docs: <https://docs.adi.foundation>\n\n### 👀 Some example use cases\n\nApps/developers that seek to sponsor gas usage for their end-users\n\n### 💼 Recruitment Opportunities\n\nWe'd like to keep in touch with talented and motivated builders for future initiatives",

They exist in a world of text and APIs, lacking persistent spatial context to inhabit, explore, and remember. By giving agents a 'home', we unlock new capabilities.\n\n### 🗂️ Bounty Category\nFeature Usage\nLaunch MVP on Testnet or Mainnet\n\n\n### 💰 Prize Amount\n$2,000\n\n\n### 🥇 Number of Projects Awarded\n3\n\n\n### 🏆 Winner Breakdown\n1st Place gets $2000\n1st - 3rd Place get a Skybox API key for one year \n\n### 📝 Requirements\nUse of Skybox AI API \n\nFree Skybox AI Essential Subscription Plan with PROMO CODE \"ETHDEN26\" skybox.blockadelabs.com/plans, will unlock access to API key\n\nFor any issues or technical support contact marguerite@blockadelabs.com\n\n### ✅ What does a successful project look like?\nSuccess means your agent demonstrates spatial awareness; it can generate, navigate, or reason about 360° environments in a way that shows memory, context, or intelligence. We're looking for projects that showcase:\n\nSpatial Memory: Agents that remember places they've visited and can recall details or return to locations\nContextual Reasoning: Agents that make decisions based on their spatial environment (e.g., \"this looks like a library, so I should whisper\")\nMulti-Environment Navigation: Agents that traverse multiple Skybox-generated worlds and maintain state across them\nCreative Generation: Agents that procedurally create environments based on user input, quests, or narratives\nCollaborative Spaces: Multiple agents interacting within the same persistent 360° environment\nPractical Applications: Real-world use cases like education, real estate visualization, or accessibility tools\n\nBonus points for integrating additional layers from the stack (Base L2, x402 payments, ERC-8004 identity) or building novel UX that makes spatial AI feel natural and useful.\n\n\n### 🎨 UI/UX Design Requirements\nThe application must have a functional user interface that demonstrates your agent's spatial awareness capabilities. Accepted formats include:\n\nBrowser-based application: Web app published to a publicly accessible demo URL (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, etc.)\nDesktop application: MCP-integrated agent running in Claude Desktop, Cursor, or any MCP-compatible client\nCommand-line interface: Terminal-based agent packaged as a Docker container or standalone executable (Windows, Linux, or macOS)\nAPI/Webhook demo: Documented API endpoint with example requests/responses and a video walkthrough\n\n\n\n### 🧑‍⚖️ How are we judging it?\nProjects will be evaluated on four core criteria:\n\n1. Skybox AI Integration (30%)\nDoes the project successfully use the Skybox AI API?\nIs the integration functional and well-implemented?\n\n2. Spatial Awareness (25%)\nDoes the agent demonstrate spatial memory, navigation, or contextual reasoning?\nCan it remember places or make decisions based on its environment?\n\n3. Impact & Creativity (25%)\nIs the use case compelling and valuable?\nDoes the demo work well and impress judges?\n\n4. Agent Autonomy (20%)\nDoes the project give agents more agency through blockchain infrastructure?\nExamples: Base L2 integration, x402 payments, ERC-8004 identity, agentic wallets, on-chain reputation, or verifiable spatial asset ownership\nNon-blockchain projects can still score here by demonstrating other forms of agent autonomy (persistent memory, decision-making, multi-agent coordination)\n\nRequirements:\nMust include working Skybox AI API integration\nMust provide a live demo URL or video walkthrough\nMust include GitHub repository with setup instructions\n\nDisqualifications:\nNo Skybox AI API usage\nNo working demo or video\nPre-existing work not built during the hackathon\n\nWinners will be selected by the Blockade Labs team. Decisions are final.\n\n\n### 🌎 Impact on the organization\nTeams working on this bounty directly advance Blockade Labs' mission to build the DOM for Spatial Reality—the foundational infrastructure that gives AI agents a persistent spatial context to inhabit, explore, and remember.\n\nImmediate impact:\nProof of concept validation: Your projects demonstrate real-world applications of spatial AI and help us understand which use cases resonate most with developers and end-users\nCommunity-driven innovation: You'll explore creative implementations we haven't considered, expanding the possibilities of what agents can do with spatial awareness\n\nLong-term impact:\nEcosystem growth: Successful projects become reference implementations that inspire future builders and accelerate adoption of spatial AI\nAgent economy foundation: Projects that integrate blockchain infrastructure (Base L2, x402, ERC-8004) help establish the trustless service economy we're building for autonomous agents\n\nProduct roadmap influence: The features you build and feedback you provide directly shape our development priorities and future releases\n\nStrategic alignment:\nThis bounty isn't just about building cool demos, it's about solving the homeless agent problem at scale. Every project that gives agents spatial memory, navigation capabilities, or environmental reasoning brings us closer to a future where AI agents are first-class citizens of the digital world, not just text-based assistants. Your work helps define what that future looks like.\n\n\n### 📚 Resources\nhttps://youtu.be/FViw2MNIm8A?si=EVslUJagtoGX-7tc\n\nhttps://api-documentation.blockadelabs.com/\n\nhttps://skybox.blockadelabs.com/prompting-guide\n\n\n\nFree Skybox AI Essential Subscription Plan with PROMO CODE \"ETHDEN26\" skybox.blockadelabs.com/plans, will unlock access to API key\n\nFor any issues or technical support contact marguerite@blockadelabs.com\n\n### 👀 Some example use cases\nSpatial Memory - Agents can remember places and the context of interactions within them\nCollaboration - Multiple agents can interact within a shared, persistent world\nTrue Agency - Agents can modify their environment, creating a feedback loop between action, perception, and ownership\nTraining Ground - Agents can learn and refine new skills in safe, persistent environments designed for experimentation and growth\n\n### 💼 Recruitment Opportunities\nBlockade is soon unveiling a new Skybox AI model, if you decide to include us in your project, please reach out to gain additional access to our unreleased next generation model.
